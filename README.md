# Diagnostic Chatbot for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs)

This project is a Diagnostic Chatbot designed to assist in the preliminary identification of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs). The chatbot uses Rasa for conversational AI and integrates a T5 Transformer model for symptom analysis and diagnosis suggestions.

## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](Project%20Diagrams/Data%20Flow%20Diagram.png)

## Features

**Symptom Collection**: Engages users in a conversational manner to collect detailed symptom information.

**Preliminary Diagnosis**: Utilizes the T5 Transformer model to analyze user-provided symptoms and suggest potential NDDs.

**Web Interface**: A user-friendly rasa.html file serves as a front-end interface for interacting with the chatbot.

**Standalone Symptom Analysis**: The T5 model can also be used separately for advanced symptom inference.

**Resource Recommendations**: Offers links to trusted resources and core knowledge about NDDs.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Patel4007/Diagnostic-Chatbot-for-NDDs.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd Diagnostic-Chatbot-for-NDDs
```

## Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional Requirements:

Install Rasa for chatbot development and transformers library for using the T5 Transformer model.

```bash
pip install rasa transformers
```

## Usage

### Train the Rasa NLU Model:

```bash
rasa train
```

### Run the Rasa Action Server (if custom actions are used):

```bash
rasa run actions
```

### Run the Chatbot Server:

```bash
rasa run
```

### Interact with the Chatbot via the Web Interface (rasa.html):

```bash
open rasa.html
```

### Interact using the Shell:

```bash
rasa shell
```

## Using the T5 Transformer Model for Standalone Inference

The chatbot integrates a T5 Transformer model for advanced symptom analysis. If needed, the T5 model can also be used separately for inference.

```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-small')
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')

input_text = "Symptoms: delayed speech, difficulty with social interaction"

inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'])
diagnosis = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(diagnosis)
```

## Data

The chatbot uses a dataset with predefined symptoms and corresponding NDD diagnoses. You can modify or expand the dataset to improve the chatbotâ€™s accuracy. Ensure that all data complies with relevant privacy regulations and ethical standards.
